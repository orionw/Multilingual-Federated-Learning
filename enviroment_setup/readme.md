You should be able to setup the enviroment like so from the main directory:

## Enviroment Setup
0. Install poetry (`bash enviroment_setup/install_poetry.sh`)
1. Activate poetry (`bash enviroment_setup/activate_poetry.sh`)
2. Install dependecies (`poetry install`)

If this fails, please consult the [poetry forums](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/) or [Github](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) for more help.
